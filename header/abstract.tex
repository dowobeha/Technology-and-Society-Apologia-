This paper investigates the socio-technological implications of the advent of fire for cooking in 500,000 BCE, examining the transformative effects of this innovation on early human societies. Drawing on archaeological evidence and anthropological insights, we explore the multifaceted nature of the relationship between the newly proposed technology of fire-based cooking and the societal dynamics of the time.
